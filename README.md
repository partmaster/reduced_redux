# reduced_redux

Implementation of the 'reduced' API for the 'Redux' state management framework with following features:

1. Support of the ```Store``` interface 
2. Register a state for management.
3. Trigger a rebuild on widgets selectively after a state change.

## Features

#### 1. Support of the ```Store``` interface 

```dart
extension ReducedStoreOnStore on redux.Store {
  reduced.Store<S> proxy<S>() => reduced.StoreProxy(
        () => state,
        (event) => dispatch(event),
        this,
      );
}
```

#### 2. Register a state for management.

```dart
class ReducedProvider<S> extends StatelessWidget {
  const ReducedProvider({
    super.key,
    required this.initialState,
    required this.child,
  });

  final S initialState;
  final Widget child;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => StoreProvider(
      store: redux.Store<S>(
        (state, action) => action is Event ? action(state) : state,
        initialState: initialState,
      ),
      child: child);
}
```

#### 3. Trigger a rebuild on widgets selectively after a state change.

```dart
class ReducedConsumer<S, P> extends StatelessWidget {
  const ReducedConsumer({
    super.key,
    required this.mapper,
    required this.builder,
  });

  final StateToPropsMapper<S, P> mapper;
  final WidgetFromPropsBuilder<P> builder;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => StoreConnector<S, P>(
        distinct: true,
        converter: (store) => mapper(store.state, store.proxy<S>()),
        builder: (context, props) => builder(props: props),
      );
}
```

## Getting started

In the pubspec.yaml add dependencies on the package 'reduced' and on the package  'reduced_redux'.

```
dependencies:
  reduced: 0.4.0
  reduced_redux: 
    git:
      url: https://github.com/partmaster/reduced_redux.git
      ref: v0.4.0
```

Import package 'reduced' to implement the logic.

```dart
import 'package:reduced/reduced.dart';
```

Import package 'reduced' to use the logic.

```dart
import 'package:reduced_redux/reduced_redux.dart';
```

## Usage

Implementation of the counter demo app logic with the 'reduced' API without further dependencies on state management packages.

```dart
// logic.dart

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reduced/reduced.dart';
import 'package:reduced/callbacks.dart';

class CounterIncremented extends Event<int> {
  @override
  int call(int state) => state + 1;
}

class Props {
  const Props({required this.counterText, required this.onPressed});

  final String counterText;
  final VoidCallable onPressed;
}

class PropsMapper extends Props {
  PropsMapper(int state, EventProcessor<int> processor)
      : super(
          counterText: '$state',
          onPressed: EventCarrier(processor, CounterIncremented()),
        );
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.props});

  final Props props;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('reduced_redux example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              const Text(
                'You have pushed the button this many times:',
              ),
              Text(props.counterText),
            ],
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: props.onPressed,
          tooltip: 'Increment',
          child: const Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      );
}
```

Finished counter demo app using logic.dart and 'reduced_redux' package:

```dart
// main.dart

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reduced_redux/reduced_redux.dart';
import 'logic.dart';

void main() => runApp(const MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => ReducedProvider(
        initialState: 0,
        child: MaterialApp(
          theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
          home: const ReducedConsumer(
            mapper: PropsMapper.new,
            builder: MyHomePage.new,
          ),
        ),
      );
}
```
